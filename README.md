# Typescript Nodejs Template

This is the template used by [create-typescript-application](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-typescript-application) and was tested against nodejs [release v16](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v16.16.0/).

To quickly create a new Typescript application for the NodeJS runtime: 

```sh
npx create-typescript-application
```
